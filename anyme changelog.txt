AnYme V6.7 (yeah I skipped 6.69)

Added a new source called AnimeHub. This source is actually pretty good since it doesn't have ads and it has dub :nauseated_face: It might be possible that a few sources won't open your video player. In that case report the show you're watching to me

Fixed an issue where the app would crash when using the Seasonal Anime function and where it wouldn't remember your selected genres

Now possible to use the "Alternative Downloader" using MasterAnimeV2

Fixed genres or synopsis not loading for certain unaired shows in the Info section of the app

GoGoAnime is back in the app (untested)

Removed an useless permission (it was named something called BIND_REFERER, this was used to detect how you installed AnYme

This version of AnYme is written in a new programming language called Kotlin. Please try out this version cause I'd like to know if everything still works

Here a list of new or fixed things

* When you receive a notification for a new episode you can now click on it and the app will automatically open the show for you

* When you click on a waifu you can now click on "Open Anime" to go to the Anime the character is in. Speaking of waifus, you now get to see the top 50 waifus in the Discover section of the app

* Fixed an issue where the alternative downloader would create a new folder for every new episode you download

* I've attempted to fix an issue where you would see a white notification icon. Not sure if it works :')

Mostly just an update with lots of behind-the-scene changes. I'd appreciate if you could update just so I can look at crashlogs again. Just use the app like you usually do.

* Fixed the AdBlocker not updating
* When you rotate your device in the recommendations screen, the app no longer re-connects to Kanon. Instead, it loads data from your memory. If this works, I'll add this mechanic everywhere in the app.

I found out a way of making layouts with little coding, so if you guys don't notice anything new it means the new change works :lick:

* Y'know the blue text for studios in the Additional Info card? You can now click on it and instead of a browser being opened, shows are now loaded natively though Kanon
* Removed the heart/unheart icon in the Favorites screen. You can no longer unfavorite a waifu by accident. To unfavorite a waifu you first have to click on them and click 'remove waifu'

Quick note for alpha users

* Keep using the Alpha version of the app, even tho I recently published "8.5"

* In the public release of AnYme, opening Settings->Accounts opens the Alpha version of the app. This is a bug. I added this feature to automatically move your Kanon from regular to Alpha (For those who had issues with their browser) but this action should be performed when you click on "migrate".

AnYme 10.13

* This version contains a rewritten version (in terms of code and user interface) of the Anime Info screen. Please give it a try.

* Note: I need suggestions on how to deal with empty states. Empty states means what should the app show when an anime doesn't have related shows, characters etc.

* Technical stuff: The Anime Info screen was originally written in Java and roughly contained 1700 lines of code. This has been reduced to 1100 while converting to Kotlin. Still a lot of code :towelman:

To start somewhere, I started with the option to write notes while you're watching an episode.

Planned features can be found here: https://trello.com/c/rUti2eDG/946-vydia-built-in-video-player

This version contains something new called Cloud sources. This is a streaming site that's dynamically added in AnYme which can be updated without requiring an apk update. If the site decides to change domain link or something else then I can update the site in the app on my server.

You can see the "Dynamic" sources in the site picker list. For now they're prefixed with "(Dyn)". This will obviously change

* Yes I'm aware that the dynamic host are also available in the app as regular hosts
